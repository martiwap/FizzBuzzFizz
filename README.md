# FizzBuzzFizz

The repo is public so it can be cloned. It is a simply console app, it can be run in Visual Studio or other editor preferred.

There is no test in it atm, this is what I could do in under 1.5 h (sorry if I am too slow!), also considering that I clearly didn't kwow what reflection was and it took me ages to "try" to use it.

Below is what was required:

“Given a range of numbers, loop through each number and output the following:
 If the number is divisible by 3 then output the word Fizz instead of the number.
 If the number is divisible by 5 then output the word Buzz instead of the number.
 If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 then output the word Fizzbuzz instead of the
number.
 If none of the above conditions are met then output the number.
